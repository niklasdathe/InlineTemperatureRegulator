# InlineTemperatureRegulator

This project was aimed at enabling temperature control for an electric heater that originally had no built-in regulation.

When my best friend told me about the situation in his new apartment – the bathroom heater had no temperature control – he wasn’t sure what to do. If the heater stayed plugged in all the time, it could lead to a massive energy bill. If he left it unplugged, mold could start to form. I felt like I could help out with a simple solution.

The project was mostly built from parts I already had on hand, with the goal of creating something quick, practical, and effective.
