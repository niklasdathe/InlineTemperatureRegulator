# InlineTemperatureRegulator
This project was aimed at allowing temperature control of an electric heater that doesn't have built in regulation

When my best friend was telling me about his situation where the electric heater in bathroom of his new appartment didnt have temperature regulation and he was worried about either racking up a huge energy bill if the heater was plugged in all  the time or mold forming if he didnt plug it in, i felt like i could help im out. This project was mostly built from part I already had and the goal was a quick and simple solution.
